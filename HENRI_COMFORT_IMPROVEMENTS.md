# Henri Comfort Control Improvements

## Issues Identified from CSV Data

From your simulation data, I identified several key problems with Henri's comfort management:

1. **Extreme temperature swings**: Indoor temperatures ranged from -8°C to +26°C
2. **Poor target temperature implementation**: Heat pump module ignored dynamic target from store
3. **Ineffective energy conservation**: Low battery mode lowered temperatures too aggressively
4. **Insufficient heat pump capacity**: 12kW was inadequate for proper temperature control
5. **Lack of temperature error-based adaptation**: Henri didn't respond to large temperature deviations

## Improvements Made

### 1. Fixed Heat Pump Configuration Passing

- **Problem**: Heat pump module used hardcoded 21°C target, ignoring adaptive target from store
- **Solution**: Now properly receives and uses `config.targetTemperature` and `config.efficiency`
- **Impact**: Heat pump now responds to Henri's adaptive temperature control

### 2. Enhanced Heat Pump Capacity and Control

- **Increased capacity**: From 12kW to 18kW for better temperature recovery
- **Improved thermal mass calculation**: More realistic building thermal response
- **Better heat loss modeling**: Accounts for continuous losses during operation
- **Proportional control**: Prevents overshoot with 80% maximum change per timestep

### 3. Smarter Low Battery Mode

- **Before**: Aggressively lowered target to 19°C, sacrificing comfort
- **After**:
  - Only reduces target by 1°C (minimum 20°C for comfort)
  - Improves heat pump efficiency by 20% (up to COP 4.5)
  - Uses better COP to achieve same heating with less energy

### 4. Enhanced Comfort Priority Mode

- **Triggers**: Now activates on comfort score < 60% OR temperature error > 3°C
- **Actions**: Boosts heat pump efficiency to 4.2 COP for faster recovery
- **Recovery**: Returns to normal only when comfort > 80% AND temperature error < 1°C

### 5. Better Temperature Control Logic

- **Realistic thermal mass**: Improved from simple floor area calculation
- **Heat loss compensation**: Accounts for ongoing building heat loss
- **Gradual temperature changes**: Prevents unrealistic instant temperature jumps

## Expected Results

With these improvements, you should see:

1. **More stable temperatures**: Indoor temperature should stay much closer to the 20-21°C target
2. **Faster recovery**: When temperatures deviate, Henri will respond more aggressively
3. **Better energy efficiency**: Smarter low-battery mode maintains comfort while conserving energy
4. **Reduced temperature extremes**: No more -8°C or +26°C indoor temperatures
5. **Responsive adaptation**: Henri will activate comfort priority mode when needed

## Key Technical Changes

### Heat Pump Module (`/src/modules/HeatPumpModule.ts`)

```typescript
// Now receives proper config
const targetTemp = config?.targetTemperature || 21
const heatPumpCOP = config?.efficiency || 3.5
const heatPumpCapacity = 18 // Increased from 12kW

// Better thermal calculations
const buildingThermalMass = envelope.floorArea * 0.5
const heatLossRate = Math.abs(tempDifference) * envelope.floorArea * 0.12
```

### Simulation Store (`/src/stores/simulation.ts`)

```typescript
// Fixed config passing
if (module.name === 'heatPump') {
  module.simulate(houseState, timestepHours, moduleConfigs.heatPump)
}

// Improved low battery mode
moduleConfigs.heatPump.efficiency = Math.min(4.5, moduleConfigs.heatPump.efficiency * 1.2)

// Enhanced comfort priority mode
const tempError = Math.abs(houseState.indoor.temperature - moduleConfigs.heatPump.targetTemperature)
if ((houseState.comfortScore < 60 || tempError > 3) && currentMode.value !== 'comfort-priority')
```

These changes should result in much better comfort management and more realistic temperature control behavior.
